  <h3><center><b> Long-term Advice </b></center></h3>
  <br>
  <ol>
    <li>  It is crucial to understand that under no circumstances is it the victim’s  fault and the blame is on the abuser.  </li>
    <br>
    <li> If you are thinking about seeking support from a therapist after sexual assault or abuse, you might have questions on your mind. That’s perfectly normal. Working with a therapist can help you deal with some of the challenges you may be facing. </li>
    <br>
    <li> Emotional self-care means different things to different people. One solution to emotional self-care is being in tune with yourself.  Visualize about a time when you felt balanced and grounded. </li>
    <br>
    <li> Having someone to reach out for support can be a essential part of staying safe and recovering. Find someone you trust who could respond to a crisis if you needed their help.	 </li>
    <br>
    <li> Try and get as much support and help as you can get. For instance, sitting with a friend so you are not alone is a great way to get support. Shock can affect people in different ways and for this reason it is good to have someone you can trust with you. </li>

  <div class="ventlist w3-container w3-animate-left">
    <h2><center><b> Some Ways To Vent: </b></center></h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li ><b style = "font-size: 21px;">Patience - </b> Be patient with yourself. There may be days when you don’t feel like doing anything or even getting out of bed. Don’t expect to be automatically functioning as you did before the attack, you have experienced a shock and need to give yourself time and be kind to yourself. </li>
      <br>
      <li><b style = "font-size: 21px;">Physical health – </b>It is important to look after your physical health because you will need strength to deal with emotional stress. You may not feel like eating, but try your best to eat something and often going without food will make you feel weaker and tired. </li>
      <br>
      <li><b style = "font-size: 21px;">Talking -  </b> One way of getting feelings out is talking about how you feel- this could be with a family member, a friend, a helpline, a counsellor, in a support group- whatever you feel comfortable with. Some find it helps to talk to others who have been through rape and or sexual assault,this can be done online through support forums if unable to access a support group. </li>
      <br>
      <li><b style = "font-size: 21px;"> Writing –  </b> Some people find it therapeutic to write down how they feel, this is a way of getting down onto paper your feelings rather than keep them inside you. </li>
      <br>
      <li><b style = "font-size: 21px;">Poetry – </b>Some find that poetry can be a good way of letting out how you really feel and many victims find this particularly therapeutic. </li>
      <br>
      <li><b style = "font-size: 21px;"> Punching Pillows/Cushions – </b> </b> This can be a good way of getting out anger and frustration– a safe way which does not hurt you or anyone else. </li>
      <br>
      <li><b style = "font-size: 21px;">Self Defense – </b> This can be helpful in getting out anger in a safe way, and also can make people feel safer and more confident. </li>
      <br>
      <li><b style = "font-size: 21px;"> Activities - </b> Exercise, walking, drama, painting, drawing– Again these are all good ways of expressing feelings. </li>
      <br>
      <li><b style = "font-size: 21px;">Friends – </b> Friends can be an important source of support, as a way of keeping a sense of normality in your life, even if you don’t feel like going out, just having the company of another trusted human being can be a source of comfort. </li>
      <br>
      <li><b style = "font-size: 21px;"> Work – </b> Some may find that going back to work actually helps the person to cope and gives them something else to focus on other than the rape. For others they may find that they need some time off from work and again. You need to do what is right for you which means being  control of your healing, choices and decisions. </li>
